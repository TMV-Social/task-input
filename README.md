# TODO

1. Create a script to refresh types: [How to gen types from supabase](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/api/rest/generating-types)
2. Use [react-markdown](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-markdown) to format text and store content in supabase as markdown.
3. I will need to strip the markdown from the database when embedding the content.
   - I could replace markdown tags with something ai could use. i.e. # = This is the main content, etc.
